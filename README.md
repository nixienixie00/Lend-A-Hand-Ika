# Lend A Hand - Micro-Volunteering Platform

Lend A Hand is an easy-to-use micro-volunteering platform developed for the TechXelerate Hackathon. Our project aims to connect volunteers with meaningful opportunities to contribute to various causes and organizations.

## Project Description

Lend A Hand provides a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLAlchemy. The platform allows users to browse and apply for micro-volunteering tasks through task cards, each providing essential details about the task, such as the title, deadline, required skills, and the cause it supports.

## How to Install and Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
 ```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lend-a-hand.git
cd lend-a-hand
 ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On macOS and Linux:
```
source venv/bin/activate

```

4. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the development server:
```
python app.py
```


The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.

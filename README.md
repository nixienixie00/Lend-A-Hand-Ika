# Lend-A-Hand

## Lend a Hand

## Anika: Have you ever wanted to feel like you were contributing to the good of your community but can’t commit long term? Or have you ever needed help with something but you can’t find the right person to lend a hand?

Rishika: What if there was a platform that allowed you to help build a stronger community in just a few clicks?

Anika: Hey, I’m Anika!

Rishika: I’m Rishika!

Inika: I’m Inika and this is our submission for the techXelerate hackathon: “Lend A Hand”.

Anika: To Lend A Hand you need to create an account. Click the “sign up” button and fill in all the necessary details. I already have an account so I’m just going to login.“Lend A Hand” is a User friendly interface that allows you to scroll through small tasks in the form of “task cards”. Task Cards are designed to summarise information about volunteer jobs, making it easier to Lend a Hand. To make the process of finding an opportunity even easier, we’ve added a filter menu so you can narrow down the list of task cards. Now you can choose tasks that suit your interests and what you think you will be suitable for. 

Rishika: The filter also allows you to select tasks that fit your schedule, whether you have 30 minutes or 5 hours there is always a way to help! Lend A Hand is mainly intended for micro-volunteering opportunities but charity organisations for example, may put up more long term roles. To learn more about the task, simply click on a task card for a detailed description. If you decide that this task is suited for you, you can choose to send a personalised email to the person/organisation in need or use the standard email. Once you have clicked “Send” an email will be sent to the user you will be Lending a Hand to, informing them about your skills and contact information so that they can contact you with the relevant details. We’ll talk about skills more a little later. 

Inika: The filter also has a feature that allows you to find jobs that are nearby and most convenient for you to tend to. It will find all the jobs that are within a specified radius of your location, so that you don’t have to go out of your way to help. 

Of course, you can’t lend a hand if there’s no one asking for a hand. Click “Ask for a Hand” in the navigation bar to post your task card. You can fill in the form which will ask for your details as well as any skills you’ll require, age requirements and the location at which the task must be completed. You can also choose to make this option “online”. For example, if you’re a charity who needs someone to make a couple of advertisements advocating for your cause, this task can be done by anyone online. All you have to do is click submit and your task card will appear on the home page.

Anika: So there you have it. Lend a Hand is our easy to use micro-volunteering platform.

Rishika: And in under 5 minutes, you could apply to make the community a better place.
